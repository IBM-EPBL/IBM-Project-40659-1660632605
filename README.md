IoT Based Smart Crop Protection System for Agriculture

problem statement 1

1. Tea Industry
a) Use of pesticides / fertilisers more than required quantity leads to rejection of the
produced Tea.
b) Plucking coarse leaves will lead to drop in the quality of made Tea.
c) Tea pruning is widely used to keep the plants in ideal shape. However, too much
pruning leads to destruction of the plant.
d) Processing of Tea from the leaves (withering, curled, fermentation, dried, sieves
and packed) is a hectic and robust job.
e) Maintaining ideal storage condition.
f) Exported / supplied stocks are rejected by the customers due to undesired quality.

2. IoT enabled micro irrigation and farming land health logging system
History-based soil health parameters like soil moisture, pHlevel, temperature etc. are very
essential of organic cultivation. IoT applications may assist in controlling the irrigation pump,
opening and closing water flowing gates and also data logging the soil health conditions for
present and future purpose. Further, with the help of IoT applications, provision for live
guidance based on stored date of soil health from professional/experts to farmers in remote
locations may be made available.

3. Revolutionising the field of Agriculture using integrated technology
Overuse of pesticides and fertilizer in agricultural fields leads to destruction of the crop as
well as reduces the efficiency of the field increasing the soil vulnerability toward pest. IoT
applications may be used to update the farmer/user about type & quantity of pesticide
required by the crop.

4. Livestock
Large farm owners can benefit from IoT applications to collect data regarding the location,
well-being, and health of their cattle. This information helps them in identifying animals that
are sick so they can be separated from the herd, thereby preventing the spread of disease. It
also lowers labor costs as ranchers can locate their cattle with the help of IoT based sensors.

5. Smart Greenhouses
Greenhouse farming is a methodology that helps in enhancing the yield of vegetables, fruits,
crops etc. Greenhouses control the environmental parameters through manual intervention or
a proportional control mechanism. IoT applications can immensely benefit the farmers using
greenhouse technology and make their work simple & easy.
